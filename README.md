## This project is on a short break
In the meantime, I am improving my submission to Kaggle's Titanic competition [here](https://github.com/Alon-Shaaltiel/Titanic_ML).  


## Do category 5 hurricanes change house price behaviour in the US?

That is the question we aim to answer using various statistical methods.

The project is currently being reorganized. 
I hope this change will force bad habits out and allow others to more easily join.  
If you are interested in contributing please contact me at: Shaaltiel.Alon@gmail.com :)  

## What we'll be working on
1. ~~Separating data collection and analysis.~~
2. ~~Moving to Jupyter notebooks.~~
3. Making sure we're always using the right tool.
4. Gathering category 4 hurricane data to get a more statistically significant result.
5. Using statistical correlation tests to test how the behaiviour changes before and after a hurricane (Event study).
6. Estimating the "All-Things-Considered Impact" (**on housing market**) of each hurricane .
7. Addressing possible biases.
