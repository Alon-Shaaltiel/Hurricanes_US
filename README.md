## Do category 5 hurricanes change house price behaviour in the US?

That is the question we aim to answer using various statistical methods.

I am currently researching similar works from the past and sources on economic prediction models.  
I believe the rate of development will slow down, please stay put.

## What we'll be working on
1. ~~Separating data collection and analysis.~~
2. ~~Moving to Jupyter notebooks.~~
3. Researching finance basics and possible real-estate and stock expected returns models.
4. Checking the validity of the models on randomly sampled data.
5. Using the validated models to check the difference between expected value and actual value after a hurricane.
6. Estimating the "All-Things-Considered Impact" (**on housing market**) of each hurricane.
7. Addressing possible biases.
