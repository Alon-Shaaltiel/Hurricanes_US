## This project is terminated
I have come to realise that I do not possess the knowledge required for this project. 
I have learned a lot by failing, I did not have accurate enough housing data and lacked solid hurricane data, as such, nothing could have come of it. I did not have a clear economic metric which would decide whether a hurricane affected an area.
I am currently improving my data science skills with theoretical and practical knowledge using Kaggle competitions and online courses.
I will start improving https://github.com/Alon-Shaaltiel/Titanic_ML over time.
