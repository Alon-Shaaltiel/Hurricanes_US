## This project is terminated
In retrospect, I do not possess the knowledge required for this project.  
I have learned a lot by failing. The housing data was not accurate enough and the hurricane data was not meant to be used in analysis, as such, nothing could have come of it. The project lacked a clear economic metric which would decide whether a hurricane affected an area.  
I am improving my data science skills with theoretical and practical knowledge using Kaggle competitions and online courses.  
Expect to see me work on https://github.com/Alon-Shaaltiel/Titanic_ML.
